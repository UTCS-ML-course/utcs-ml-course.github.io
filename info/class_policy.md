## Attendance

We strongly encourage you to be present in all lectures (Mondays and Wednesdays, 3:30 - 5:00 PM). We will however record and post lectures and notes. Class participation points will be awarded based on class attendance and interaction during class hours. 

## Office hours

See [staff page](/info/staff) or [course calendar](/info/calendar/#course-calendar) for up-to-date office hours information.

## Grading, lateness, and extensions 

The grade break-down will be as follows:
- Homework: 40%
- Final project: 30%
- Midterm exam: 25%
- Class Participation: 5%

Late homework:
- You have a total of 3 late days for all the homework. You can use all 3 late days for one assignment or distribute your 3 late days over multiple assignments. After you've exhausted all 3 late days, a late penalty of 20% per day will be applied to any late submissions.

Late projects:
- Final project deadline is strict, no late days are allowed. 

Extensions:
- If you are having health or personal problems, definitely take it easy. Email us and we will make arrangements for extensions. 
- *There will be no further extensions given for other reasons*

## Collaboration with computers

- You should **NOT** use AI-assistants, such as co-pilot, for help with any coding assignments.  
- You may use large language models to assist with superficial grammatical corrections of your writing, but not to provide or suggest content.

In all cases, you remain personally responsible for the originality, correctness, and quality of your submissions.
