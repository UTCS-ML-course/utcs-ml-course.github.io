## Course Overview

This graduate course can be more aptly titled Fundamentals of Machine Learning. It is a gateway course to more advanced and specialized graduates courses on the topic, for example, courses that specialize in deep learning. To enjoy the course you should have a solid background in linear algebra, probability and statistics, and multivariate calculus. Refreshers on these topics will be done in class but they will necessarily be brief. If you are weak in any of these, you may find the course challenging. Topics covered include supervised methods (regression, classification), unsupervised methods (clustering, principal components analysis, non-linear dimensionality reduction), and self-supervised learning. The technical tools used in the course will draw from linear algebra, probability, multivariate statistics and optimization. Check reference books [here](/resources/books/#textbooks).

**Pre-requisites**: Basics (undergraduate level) of linear algebra (M341 or equivalent).
